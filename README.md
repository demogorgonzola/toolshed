So far we got...

##### _Chrome bois_
* ### chrome-no-cors
Run chrome without CORS.
(Note: you or someone above you should have fixed this)

#### _Docker dudes_
* ### docker-exec
Run a command in the docker container
* ### docker-kill-all
Just kill it all, every running container
* ### docker-nuke
When killing it isn't enough, literally destroy everything docker has created
* ### docker-rm-all-containers
Deletes all the containers docker cooked up
* ### docker-rm-all-volumes
Deletes all the places docker was puttin' those containers
* ### docker-shell
Quick SSH into the docker shell

#### _Handy Jabronies_
* ### I-OWN-YOU
**_"I swear to fucking god if you give me lip"_**
This helps take control of a file if some dumbass shenanigans are going
on with running permissions changes that place it outside or your
permission groups.
* ### YOU-OWN-THIS
**_"Oh, so it only takes permission when it spins the container up.
WOW, that's so fucking useless for production!"_** This is a more
flexible version of I-OWN-THIS, a little less "I" and a little more
"someone elses problem".

#### _secret fellas...ssshhhhhhh_
* ### .atom-setup
This dude, lemme tell you about this dude. He DELETES YOUR ENTIRE ```.atom``` folder and then replaces it with a better one.
* ### .atom-packup
It's like a crappy save for atom configs that you want to put on other machines. Fantastic. A+.
